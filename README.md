# Fallout Vore

## Developing

* Install the recommended extension, `joelday.papyrus-lang-vscode`.
* You should have Fallout 4 and the creation kit installed to the typical Steam location. Launch each of them at least once.
* Build the scripts with /Terminal -> Run Task.../ and pick `pyro: Compile Project (FalloutVore.ppj)`
* Build the packages/mod with the task `Powershell: build`
